                <br />
                <Typography variant='body1'>As any developer will tell you, coding without documentation is a bit like flying without a radar. Having clear, concise, and approachable technical documentation not only makes devs lives easier, but it can be used by our sales team as a powerful marketing tool. The previous documentation hub, known as Developer Portal, was lacking in several aspects: visual clarity, performance, accessibility, and the technology had several layers of technical debt. The decision was made to scrap the previous site entirely, and build something completely new: an AWS integrated, markdown powered CMS running on Grav. Elavon has thousands of pages of technical documentation, so converting it from PDF and organizing it was no small undertaking.

                <Typography variant='body1'>Much of the documentation that needed migrating was in PDF format, and ultimately the most accessible form is HTML. During my downtime from designing I pitched in on the tech writing team to convert some exisiting docs.

                <br />
                <Typography variant='body1'>As we weren't able to adopt Figma at the time, the lead developer and I devised a method of pushing all of my Sketch updates to an internal git repo so that everything would be clearly backed up and documented. This helped him understand what the main changes were since everything was in one file. This also helped me become familiar with Git early on in my career while I was still enrolled full time at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

                <Typography variant='body1'>I was frequently amazed at the age of much of Elavon's internal systems, including the team of COBOL developers everyone collectively referred to as "the dinosaurs" ðŸ¦•. But in many ways, it's a testament to the original developers that these financial systems continue to function largely without issue decades later. The information architect made sure that I understood that while designs may follow the whims of trends or the capabilities of new front end systems, the underlying data structure can last quite a long time.

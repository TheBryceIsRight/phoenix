                    <Typography variant='body1'>One of my first initiatives upon entering this role was to standardize all major UI components in a design system.

                    <Typography variant='body1'>Quickly into my role at AllVoices I outpaced the rate of new design work, which led to me adopting an entire second role: full stack developer. As front end had enough resources, I primarily wrote back end APIs in Node.js within Next.js using GraphQL. I would also occaisonally take front end React stories so that I could link the two sides of the feature together. Few developers on staff had an understanding of the platform from both angles, so I was also a resource for bug diagnosis and remidation.

                    <Typography variant='body1'>While some designers may scoff at the idea that learning to code is important, it is impossible to fully account for what you're asking someone to build for you unless you grasp how they are doing it. Joining the back end team and closing PRs gave me a much better understanding of the scope of work required anytime someone recommended a new feature or product.

                    <Typography variant='body1'>While I could prevent many accessibility issues from being introduced on the design side, having access to the entire tech stack of the application across the different development teams gave me far more power to fix these issues. I diagnosed, documented, tracked, and remediated over 400 issues across the platform. I also tried my best to educate the development team on best practices so as to not introduce any further problems.

She knows her limits and will try to limit larger, more complex requirements that will require more time than she has. She prefers to use commerical off the shelf software to fill gaps in her implementation to reduce overall level of effort", "Persona 2 - Sami loves solving hard problems. He expects RESTful APIs in line with modern standards, but he is faimliar with other varieties. He expects clean designs, clear techincal communication, and he wont call a customer support line unless someone really twists his arm.", "Persona 3 - Olivia leads a team of developers. She recives daily updates about their progress. She is making commitments to business stakeholders regarding launch dates and when features become available. She determines whether an integration partner is leading to success.", "Persona 4 - Sophia has always loved reading, so her fading eyesight is a real sorrow to her. She tried recorded books, but she didn’t like listening instead of seeing the words in front of her. As a bookkeeper for 25 years, she made the transition from ledgers to a software program, so she’s happy to use the computer. She has an oldhome computer, which she uses the same way she always did her work—carefully checking everything as she goes. She loves getting emails fromher grandkids (and a few friends). She likes reading magazine articlesonline, especially when they are free. Last year, she discovered that shecould get her prescriptions more cheaply online, and now she buys somethings from the web. ", "Persona 5 - Jacob is a paralegal in a large law firm. He reviews cases and writes summaries, cross-referencing them to the firm’s own cases and clients. He’s building expertise in his area of law and is hoping to go to law school in a year or so.As far as Jacob is concerned, it’s the technology that’s handicapped, not him. When everything is in place, he can work just as fast and just as effectively as anyone in his office. He’s a bit of a gadget geek, always trying out new tools, looking for a little edge and something new.", "Persona 6 - The nice thing about being a graphic artist is that most of the time his work can speak for itself.When he first started working, most reviews were done in meetings, but more and more his agency works with clients using online workspaces. He’s had some projects recently where all of the communication was through the web. Although he likes seeing live reactions, it’s easier for him to participate in the project forum discussions using text rather than audio. His iPhone has also been important. It was his first phone with a good way to do video chat so he could talk to his friends who sign.", "Persona 7 - Lea was on track to become the editor of the magazine she worked for when she started having numbness in her hands and feeling completely fatigued by the middle of the afternoon. She tried medications and exercise and getting enough sleep, but finally she had to make a change in her life.She found a job where she could work from home, on her own schedule. When she has good days, it’s like nothing is wrong. But on bad days, she measures every action so she can make it through the day. She’s lucky: the company understands that it’s a real disability. With aninvisible disability like fibromyalgia, some people just don’t get it.", "Persona 8 - After graduating from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras,Dyia went to a postgraduate program at UC Berkeley. Her work on visualizing data landed her a job with a multinationalmedical technology company. Diya was diagnosed with glaucoma and her eyes have been getting steadily worse, despite treatment.

He attends a special school where the teachers and staff can help with his social and communication challenges from his Autism Spectrum Disorder, while he works to pass his high school exams.He has problems with visual information and recognizing things on the page, and his reading skills are not helped by his trouble concentrating on the page or screen long enough to read. His teachers showed him how to make the text bigger on the page, and told him how to use a printable view to hide all the ads with moving images that distract him, because he reads every word on the page very carefully and literally. He can be easily confused by colloquialisms and metaphors. He can also be overwhelmed by sites that offer too many choices.", "Persona 10 - Walter comes from a traditional German family. He grew uphelping his parents and older relatives navigate the English-speakingworld. His work as a community health worker is a natural extension.
